# Data-Science-Projects using Python

1. **Cencus Data(Imbalanced-Techniques Project)**: (https://github.com/muj1og/Data-Science-Project/blob/master/census%20data(project)-Copy1.ipynb) 
I chose this datasets because imbalanced-data really challanging to work with
and data sets is tricky. simple classifcation algorithem tend to struggle. the data set in this project failry large and high dimensional and i'hv covered data analysis and machine learning skills and how ML project bulid.
 

2. **20 Machine Learning project** (https://github.com/muj1og/Data-Science-Project/blob/master/20%20machine%20learning.ipynb)
My main focus on this project was on how to apply diffrent machine learning to model regardless what the data set is, therefore i chose to predict wine quality dataset and is one of the most popular datasets along data science. It is divided into 2 datasets. You can perform both regression and classification tasks on this data and this what i want it.

3. **Loan prediction project** (https://github.com/muj1og/Data-Science-Project/blob/master/Loan%20Prediction.ipynb)
Among all industries, the insurance domain has one of the largest uses of analytics & data science methods. This dataset provides a taste of working on data sets from insurance companies â€“ what challenges are faced there, what strategies are used, which variables influence the outcome, etc. This is a classification problem. 


4. **py-SQL in pandas** (https://github.com/muj1og/Data-Science-Project/blob/master/py-SQL%20in%20Pandas.ipynb) Acessing Data from a SQLite Database and then, just reitrate that getting data from database to perform data science process that how, (and thus, has no effect upon the rest of the data science process), Instead of reading data from a CSV file, we get it from a database and built a machine learning model in top of it.
