# Data-Science-Projects

1. **Cencus Data(Imbalanced-Techniques Project)**: (https://github.com/muj1og/Data-Science-Project/blob/master/census%20data(project)-Copy1.ipynb) 
I chose this datasets because imbalanced-data really challanging to work with
and at the same time to boost my knowldge and skills as a data scentist and push my computer 
hardware to the limits.!
In real life imbalanced datasets can be found in many senario for example- fraud detection,
cancer detection, manfacturing defects, online ads conversion etc. i achived an score of 77% of the minrioty class and always there is room for improvement!. 

2. **20 Machine Learning project** (https://github.com/muj1og/Data-Science-Project/blob/master/20%20machine%20learning.ipynb)
My main focus on this project was on how to apply diffrent machine learning to model regardless what the data set is, therefore i chose to predict wine quality dataset and is one of the most popular datasets along data science. It is divided into 2 datasets. You can perform both regression and classification tasks on this data and this what i want it.

3. **Loan prediction project** (https://github.com/muj1og/Data-Science-Project/blob/master/Loan%20Prediction.ipynb)
Among all industries, the insurance domain has one of the largest uses of analytics & data science methods. This dataset provides a taste of working on data sets from insurance companies â€“ what challenges are faced there, what strategies are used, which variables influence the outcome, etc. This is a classification problem. 


4. **py-SQL in pandas** (https://github.com/muj1og/Data-Science-Project/blob/master/py-SQL%20in%20Pandas.ipynb) Acessing Data from a SQLite Database and then, just reitrate that getting data from database to perform data science process that how, (and thus, has no effect upon the rest of the data science process), Instead of reading data from a CSV file, we get it from a database and built a machine learning model in top of it.
