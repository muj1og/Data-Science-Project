1.Cencus BigData(Imbalanced-Techniques Project): https://github.com/muj1og/Data-Science-Project/blob/master/census%20data(project)-Copy1.ipynb 
I chose this datasets to work with because imbalanced-data really challanging to work with
and at the same time to boost my knowldge and skills as a data scentist and push my computer 
hardware to the limits.
In real life imbalanced datasets can be found in many senario for example- fraud detection,
cancer detection, manfacturing defects, online ads conversion etc.
